Members of the list can contribute new tasks but do not have the right to delete existing ones. The app is designed with a focus on user-friendliness, featuring an intuitive interface that enables quick navigation. Users can see their lists and mark tasks as completed, which helps track progress. Overall, the To-Do List is a powerful tool that promotes collaboration and efficient task organization.",
